2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0_1 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on resetn relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_uart_puf/inst/puf/state_mac/valid_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_uart_puf/inst/puf/state_mac/valid_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin i_system_wrapper/system_i/clk_wiz_48mhz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0, clkfbout_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin i_system_wrapper/system_i/clk_wiz_48mhz/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0, clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_48mhz_0_1
Related violations: <none>
